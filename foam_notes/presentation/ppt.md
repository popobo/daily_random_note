**Corresponding English Script:**

**[Slide 1]**
"Good morning everyone! Today I'll introduce a jewel of world literature - *The Little Prince*. This poetic novella has sold over 140 million copies worldwide, translated into 300+ languages. Let's explore why this 'children's book for adults' remains profoundly relevant."

**[Slide 2]**
"Before we dive into the story, let's understand its creator. Saint-Exupéry wasn't just a writer - his aviation adventures deeply shaped the book's themes. Notice how desert isolation and stargazing imagery mirror his real-life plane crashes. His mysterious WWII disappearance adds another layer to the story's cosmic wonder."

**[Slide 3]**
"At its core, this is a story within a story. The frame narrative shows a stranded pilot, while the main plot follows the prince's cosmic journey. Through his visits to different planets, we'll encounter satirical portraits of adult fixations - from power to consumerism."

**[Slide 4]**
"Let's meet key figures. The prince embodies pure, unfiltered curiosity - a mirror showing our lost childhood selves. The fox delivers the book's most famous lesson about emotional bonds. The rose represents fragile yet precious relationships we nurture."

**[Slide 5]**
"Now to the big ideas. The book's central paradox urges us to value invisible emotional truths over visible realities. Through the prince's eyes, we see how adults obsess over meaningless metrics while ignoring life's true essence."

**[Slide 6]**
"These memorable lines stay with readers forever. Let's unpack the most iconic one: 'Essential is invisible' - how does this apply to modern life? Maybe our screen-time metrics can't measure true connection, or salary numbers don't reflect job satisfaction."

**[Slide 7]**
"Why choose this book? Beyond its lyrical beauty, it's a wake-up call. In our productivity-obsessed world, the prince reminds us to watch sunsets, talk to flowers, and prioritize who/what we 'tame' through caring commitment."

**[Slide 8]**
"Let's reflect: If the prince visited our digital world, what would he think of social media 'vanity planets'? How might he interpret our emoji conversations? I'll leave you with the fox's wisdom about building real connections - a challenge to us all in this age of instant messaging."
